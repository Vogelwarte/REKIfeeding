# REKIfeeding
This repository contains the code to replicate results in a submitted manuscript examining the anthropogenic feeding of red kites in Switzerland. NOTE that the raw data are too large to be stored on GitHub, and those data must therefore be downloaded/requested from Movebank via the script "Feeding_data_prep.R".

The abstract of the manuscript follows below:
Many wildlife species consume food or refuse provided by humans. To understand the effect of anthropogenic food subsidies on wildlife populations, we first need to quantify where and when individuals can access such food sources. The red kite Milvus milvus is an opportunistic raptor species and uses both inadvertent and deliberate food subsidies provided by citizens. Here we present a new approach using GPS-tracking data to predict where anthropogenic food subsidies likely occur. We tracked 497 individuals with solar-powered GPS transmitters over an average of 3.2 (range 1 â€“ 9) breeding seasons in Switzerland, and combined these data with locations of 125 known feeding sites obtained through interviews. We used two sequential random forest models, at both individual movement and population levels, to predict where anthropogenic food subsidies were attended by red kites. The first model classified locations that were frequently and regularly revisited, and successfully predicted 85% of locations that were within 50 m of an externally validated feeding site. These predicted locations were aggregated in 500 m grid cells to calculate the proportion of individuals and locations associated with predicted food subsidy. A second model related the presence of known food subsidies to the aggregated predictions. In our study area, 80% of known anthropogenic food provision locations could be correctly identified using red kite tracking data, but data sparsity beyond the core range of tracked individuals limits predictions of anthropogenic food subsidies at larger geographic scales. Nonetheless, biologging data can identify ephemeral food sources, and facilitate an assessment of the importance of anthropogenic food subsidies on the fitness of individuals in tracked populations.
